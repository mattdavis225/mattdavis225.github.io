# OM 620 – Tools & Technologies for Business Analytics Projects

This page serves as a hub for my work in **OM 620 Tools & Technologies for Business Analytics** at California State University San Marcos, while working on my Masters in Supply Chain Analytics.  
The course focuses on applying analytics tools (Python, Jupyter, and statistical methods) to real-world style business datasets.

## Inventory Analytics & Safety Stock Project

**Course:** OM 620 – Tools & Technologies for Business Analytics  
**Topic:** Inventory analytics, data cleaning, and safety stock calculation

In this project I:

- Cleaned and validated a large transactional dataset (orders, lead times, sites, SKUs, stocking policies).
- Filtered the data to **Finished Goods (FG)** that are **Make to Stock (MTS)**.
- Built SKU-level demand statistics (min, max, mean, median, variance, std dev, lead time).
- Calculated safety stock for multiple service levels using:
  - A traditional **normal-distribution** formula.
  - An **empirical (quantile-based)** method using historical demand.

The work for **Assignment 1** and **Assignment 2** is combined into a single, well-documented notebook.
